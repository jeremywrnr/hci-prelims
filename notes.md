# how bodies matter

bjoern, srk. The human body has skill and dexterity which digital interaction
techniques do not full take advantage of. The mental modal of the ideal user of
a GUI would be that of a massive eye and finger. Five key concepts are
introduced when can be used as generative and evaluative design tools when
considering interactive technology. They are: thinking through doing,
performance, visibility, risk, and thickness of practice. People gesture not
only to communicate but also to lighten the mental load they are under. For
example, mouthing out these words as I am typing them refines my sense of my
own voice.

# read-wear edit-wear

jim hollan draws on schoen's theory of interfaces prompting a reflective
conversation for shaping problem-setting, which lies at the heart of
professional work, rather than many applications which instead focus on
problem-solving, and therefore already harden the context in which the problem
is framed. he embeds the wear of the document into the scrollbar of a zmacs
editor, and gives other examples of how wear could be implemented into existing
interface elements, essentially creating the data for a heat map of where the
interface is being used. the great things is that it does not require any
additional action by the user - essentially it comes 'free', though there are
issues of privacy and data ownership when it comes to the actual usage data.

# the computer for the 21st century

mark weiser introduces the concept of the computer for the 21st century by
introducing pads, tabs, and boards. these would be cheap, almost disposable
sources of computation that would lie in our environment in the same way that
writing is embedded into the world around us. he imagines embedded virtuality:
drawing the computer into the world, rather than simply creating a new world
and then drawing the user into it, which disrupts and isolates the communities
and workplaces that we operate inside of.

# groupware: challenges for developers

jonathan grudin, '94, presents 8 challenges for developers. separations exist
between orgs, groups, and users, and software applications for each of these
vary greatly, along with the issues faces while developing them, and even
beyond development to acceptance. grudin specifically presents the central
challenges that groupware developers face. first there was software for orgs,
than users, and now groups. because individuals act with a groupware
application, it has all the interface design challenges along with new
challenges stemming from its involvement in group processes. groupware at the
time of writing: email, bboard. 8 main challenges, work/benefit disparity,
critical mass, social process disruption, exception handling, unobtrusive
accessibility, evaluation difficulty, intuition failure, hard adoption. But!
There is hope... while considering a new, 'work' perspective.

# contextual inquiry ch3

to gain more understanding, go where the user or customer works. four
principles should guide how you act during this inquiry: context, partnership
interpretation, and focus. start off with the master/apprenticeship model but
realize that you are a designer and not an apprentice, so therefore you must
act differently, your time is limited, and instead of learning how to do the
task you must learn how to collect data to feed invention of a system, that
supports the work. this would be found in a partnership, where the shared focus
is the current task at hand. interpretation: fact -> hypothesis
(interpretation) -> implication, design idea. there is a structure that should
be followed during these inquiries, namely a conventional interview to get
things started, than an explicit stating of expectations during the work
session, the actual observations during work execution, and then a followup
interview where presentations of the what was gleaned from the inquiry and
passed back through the customer for a final stage of vetting.
