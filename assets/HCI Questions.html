<h3 align="center">(HCI)</h3>
<blockquote>
<br>
<br>
<pre><strong>(Fall 2012 - Hartmann &amp; Agrawala):</strong>
Questions
=========

Q1: Direct Manipulation and Computational Wear

* List the core principles of direct manipulation user interfaces.
* Consider two types of mobile UIs: touch-controlled and voice-controlled.
  Which type of interface is more "direct" and why?
* Draw the user-system dialog. Where do articulatory and semantic
  distances appear? What is the difference between them? Give a concrete
  example how interfaces may reduce one type of distance.
* What are computational forms of "wear" and how do they conceptually
  fit into the direct manipulation paradigm?

Q2: Contextual Inquiry from Beyer and Holzblatt

Describe the relationship that should hold in contextual inquiry between
researcher and subject.

List the four principles of contextual inquiry (Context, Partnership,
Interpretation, Focus).For each principle, give concrete examples of *how*
it should be applied, and *why* it contributes to understanding of user
practices.

Q3: Evaluation Methods
* Tohidi et al. claim that "Testing many is better than testing one".
  What concrete evaluation methodology do they argue for - and what
  advantages do they claim?
* Kohavi also advocates for testing alternatives - contrast his approach
  with Tohidi et al.'s. What are the strengths and limitations of each
  approach? At which stage of design is each appropriate?
* You are building a website and want to increase the time your users
  spend on the site. Think of a design intervention and how you would
  test it. What would your independent and dependent variables be? What
  kind of statistical tests would you apply and what would they tell you
  about the results?

Q4: End-User Software Engineering from the reading by Andrew Ko et al.

How did Ko et al. define "end-user software engineering"?

List the 5 stages of EUSE practice (Requirements, Design and Specification,
Reuse, Testing, Debugging).Using these 5 stages, contrast the practices of
EU programmers and professional programmers.

In the process, list some common EU programming examples (spreadsheets,
web design, scripts,...)

<pre><strong>(Spring 2012 - Hartmann &amp; Agrawala):</strong>

Q1: INPUT DEVICES
=================
* What are the differences between an absolute, a relative,
  a direct and an indirect input device as defined by Hinckley?
  Give an example for each.
* What is gain, or c:d ratio, and how does it apply to direct
  and indirect devices?
* The 3-state model of input: What are the three states?
  How does the three-state model help designers reason about input devices
  and appropriate interaction techniques? Discuss at least two devices
  and their differences. Draw diagrams if you think it will help your argument.
* What is a morphological design space and why would one create
  such a space for input devices? 

Q2: VISUAL VARIABLES
====================
* What is the difference between nominal, ordinal and quantitative
  variables?  Give an example of each. 
* Name several retinal properties of marks and explain whether each
  retinal property is effective for depicting nominal, ordinal
  and/or quantitative data.
* Some visual variables are better than others for depicting
  quantitative data.  Pick two visual variables (say position and
  grayscale) and describe how you would design an experiment to test
  which of the two visual variables is more effective for quantitative
  data.

Q3, ALTERNATIVE 1: EMBODIED INTERACTION &amp; DIRECT MANIPULATION
==============================================================
* List the five themes from the How Bodies Matter. Briefly describe
  how each theme argues for embodied interaction and give an example.
* What is tacit knowledge and why would we care about it in the design
  of interfaces?
* What are the similarities and differences in perspective between
  direct manipulation and embodied interaction?


Q3, ALTERNATIVE 2: SEARCH AND BROWSING
======================================
* What is information scent?
* You are designing a search user interface to compete with Google.
  Explain strategies you might use for maximizing information scent
  during web search.
* A redesign led to lower click-through rates. Argue whether this
  should be interpreted as higher or lower scent.
* What is faceted metadata and why is it useful for browsing?


Q4: FITTS' LAW
==============
* What is Fitts' Law?
* What are the basic assumptions of the Fitts' Law model.
* What is the steering law? Researchers have experimentally learned that
  we can model another constrained pointing task as: (draw two
  goal-crossing version of task), using a similar formula (write
  two-goal formula on board).  How would you extend this approach to
  derive the steering law?
