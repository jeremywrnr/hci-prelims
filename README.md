# cal hci prelims

You will be responsible for material from CS160 and CS260, and a short list of addition readings.

from: http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bjoern/prelims

## CS160

We may ask about material from the following core readings of this course:

- Norman, The Design of Everyday Things. Chapter 1: The Psychology of Everyday Things (2013 version).
- Hutchins, Hollan, Norman. Direct Manipulation Interfaces, (also assigned in CS260)
- Raskin, The Humane Interface, Chapter 2: Cognetics and the Locus of Attention,3,4: Quantification.
- Hinckley and Wigdor, Input Technologies and Techniques (also assigned in CS260)
- Card, Moran and Newell, The Model Human Processor. Ch2 of The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction.
- Card, Mackinlay, Schneiderman. Readings in Information Visualization. Chapter 1: Information Visualization.
- Martin, Doing Psychology Experiments. (Chapter 2 and Chapter 12 are especially relevant, but the whole book is worthwhile. Alternatively: other readings on the scientific method and inferential statistics.)
- Beyer and Holtzblatt, Contextual Inquiry, Ch 3: Principles of Contextual Inquiry.
- Nielsen, How to Conduct a Heuristic Evaluation and 10 Usability Heuristics.
- Olsen, Building Interactive Systems, Ch 1 + 3:Architectures of Interactive Systems + Event Handling
- Shneiderman, Plaisant, Coen, Jacobs. Designing the User Interface. Chapter 9, Collaboration and Social Media Participation.
- In addition to these readings, you will probably find slides from the class helpful. Look at the Spring 2014 offering of CS160.
